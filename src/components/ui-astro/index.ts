/**
 * Astro UI Component Library
 *
 * These components mirror the React UI components but work natively in Astro
 * without requiring client-side JavaScript.
 *
 * Usage in Astro files:
 * ```astro
 * import { Badge, Card, Container } from '../components/ui-astro';
 * ```

// Re-export all Astro components
